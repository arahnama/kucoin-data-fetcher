Cryptocurrency markets are renowned for their volatility and unpredictability, making reliable and timely data essential for anyone
looking to analyze trends or develop trading strategies. In this guide, Iâ€™ll walk through how to programmatically fetch historical SOL/USDT price data from KuCoin, 
one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, using Python. This process involves interacting with the KuCoin API to retrieve and store data, ensuring you have access to precise historical price movements for analysis.

In order to get API keys from KuCoin, please check out my page:

I opted for the KuCoin platform for my trading activities, but feel free to explore and use a platform that suits you best, like Coinbase, for instance.

Prerequisites
First, you need to register in your trading platform. Then access to your API keys.

Before you start coding, make sure to install the ccxt library in your Python environment. 
This library facilitates seamless interaction with a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges. 
You'll also require pandas, an essential library for robust data manipulation tasks. 

For handling timezone conversions, the pytz library is necessary. 
In this guide, we'll convert timestamps from KuCoin to the Toronto, EST timezone, since that's where I'm based in Canada. However,
you can easily adjust this to match your local timezone, allowing for the conversion of timestamps to your specific regional time.
